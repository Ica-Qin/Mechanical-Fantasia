# 🐺 The Wolf

## Project Overview
This is my first attempt at making a movable kinetic sculpture. I was trying to achieve an effect where a wolf's head is suspended in the air, so I used an acrylic pipe as the lower support.

However, it turned out that the acrylic pipe was not strong enough during the sculpture's move. I'll try other materials in the future. 

Fortunately, the gear operated by servos successfully controls the wolf to "float" and open/close its mouth. I'm considering adding sounds during the mouth movements.
