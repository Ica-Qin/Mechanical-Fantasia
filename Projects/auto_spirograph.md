**Automatic Spirograph Box **
---

## Overview

### Project Description:  
The original project featured two 360Â° servos and four rectangular strips to let a pencil continuously draw on paper. When the two servos rotated, the pencil connected would draw as a harmonograph.

## Design Justification 

I used pretty simple code and only two servos to make this project and made more effort with the physical design of the gears and the box. To have the box and gears fit right in with each other took most of my working time.

My first decision on remixing this project was just to make the pen draw something that was not so random. In the beginning, I tried to find solutions by adding more servos and strips. However, later when I searched for "harmonograph", it reminded me of the drawing toy children always play with, so gears came into my mind. Compared with the spirograph which needs people to use a pen to move the inside gear, I decided that I could use servos and additional gears to move the outside gear to let the inside one rotate on itself.

When opening the automatic harmonograph, it would seem like the pen inserted in the inner gear moves on itself and continuously draws on its own. The graph on the paper becomes darker and darker. It can be seen as a magical box or a staying memory of a young age. Most of us went far away from the time we were playing with harmonograph painting tools, but the box is like a storage of the behaviour. It could never be stopped, like memories never truly go.

## My feedbacks
I received a lot of feedback about the look of the box and also the harmonograph part. One of the feedback I found really useful is that "simple servo movements can translate to so much". Another one I like so much is: "The Pen Keeps Drawing", which gave me some feeling about the artistic parts of this project.

Some students asked me if the graph could be changed by changing the inside gear and the answer was definitely yes. They gave me an idea about upgrading this project by making some more gears in different sizes and shapes, which would lead to interesting results in the final graph painted.
